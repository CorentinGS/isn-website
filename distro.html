          The expert distro : <a href="https://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Arch Linux adheres to five principles: simplicity, modernity,
          pragmatism, user centrality and versatility. In general, the
          principles maintain minimal distribution-specific changes, minimal
          breakage with updates, pragmatic over ideological design choices.
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, meaning there are no "major
          releases" of completely new versions of the system; a regular system
          update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the
          installation images released by the Arch team are simply up-to-date
          snapshots of the main system components.<br />Arch Linux has
          comprehensive documentation, which consists of a community wiki known
          as the ArchWiki.
        </p>
        <p>
          Personally, this is the distro I use. I find it very good for learning
          more about Linux. The rolling release philosophy also avoids some
          compatibility issues on recent hardware, especially with nvidia.
          However, I don't recommend it to novices.

          The novice distro : <a href="https://getsol.us/home/">Solus OS</a>

        <p>
          Solus is an operating system that is designed for home computing.
          Every tweak enables us to deliver a cohesive computing experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solus provides a multitude of experiences that enable you to get the
          most out of your hardware. From our flagship Budgie experience for
          modern devices to the more traditional MATE experience for lower-end
          devices, Solus aims to provide the best experience for your device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Solus ships with a variety of software out of the box so you can get
          going without a lot of setup fuss. See our selection of default
          applications below!
        </p>
        <p>
          From my point of view, solus is a modern and attractive distribution
          for all new linux users. The community is very friendly and it's easy
          to find support on their forum. Moreover, it is a distribution that
          features all the new technologies and keeps it up to date. I used it
          for a long time and I still highly recommend it.

          The development distro :
          <a href="https://system76.com/pop">Pop!_OS</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Pop!_OS is a Linux distribution, based on Ubuntu and using the GNOME
          Desktop Environment. It is intended for use by "developers, makers,
          and computer science professionals". Pop!_OS provides full disk
          encryption by default as well as streamlined window management,
          workspaces, and keyboard shortcuts for navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compatibility is something that most distributions don’t have a huge
          problem with, but Pop!_OS takes it to the next level. They two
          different Pop!_OS downloads: one for Intel/AMD drivers and one for
          Nvidia.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had the opportunity to test this distro to resolve compatibility
          issues with my nvidia optimus card. And it turns out that Pop!_OS is
          probably the simplest solution to fix this common problem on Linux
          systems. Moreover, as Ubuntu based, it offers a wide range of packages
          which greatly simplifies its use and documentation.

          The customizable distro : <a href="https://neon.kde.org">KDE Neon</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The latest and greatest of KDE community software packaged on a
          rock-solid base.
        </p>
        <p>
          KDE neon is the intersection of these needs using a stable Ubuntu
          long-term release as its core, packaging the hottest software fresh
          from the KDE Community ovens. Compute knowing you have a solid
          foundation and enjoy the features you experience in the world's most
          customisable desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should use KDE neon if you want the latest and greatest from the
          KDE community but the safety and stability of a Long Term Support
          release. When you don't want to worry about strange core mechanics and
          just get things done with the latest features. When you want your
          computer as your tool, something that belongs to you, that you can
          trust and that delivers day after day, week after week, year after
          year. Here it is: now get stuff done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I haven't used KDE Neon personally but I've heard nothing but good
          feedback. It is a reliable and efficient distribution. It allows you
          to take full advantage of KDE which is highly configurable. I really
          like this distribution which can be used as a transition to more
          sophisticated distros such as Arch or Gentoo.
