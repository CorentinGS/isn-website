          </header>
          <p>
            Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system.<br />
            In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android,
            is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is
            software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with
            your desktop or laptop.<br />
            To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication
            between your software and your hardware. Without the operating
            system (OS), the software wouldn't function.

            <h2><i class="fab fa-linux"></i> Why Linux</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            This is the one question that most people ask.<br />
            Why bother learning a completely different computing environment,
            when the operating system that ships with most desktops, laptops,
            and servers works just fine?<br />

            To answer that question, I would pose another question. Does that
            operating system you're currently using really work just fine ?<br />
            Or, do you find yourself battling obstacles like viruses, malware,
            slow downs, crashes, costly repairs, and licensing fees ?<br />
            If you struggle with the above, Linux might be the perfect platform
            for you. Linux has evolved into one of the most reliable computer
            ecosystems on the planet. <br />
            Combine that reliability with zero cost of entry and you have the
            perfect solution for a desktop platform.<br />

            That’s right, zero cost of entry… as in free. You can install Linux
            on as many computers as you like without paying a cent for software
            or server licensing.

            <h2><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Open source</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            Linux is also distributed under an open source license. Open source
            follows these key tenants:
          </p>
          <div id="list">
            <ul>
              <li>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</li>
              <li>
                The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to
                make it do what you wish.
              </li>
              <li>
                The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your
                neighbor.
              </li>
              <li>
                The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
                others.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
            These points are crucial to understanding the community that works
            together to create the Linux platform. <br />
            Without a doubt, Linux is an operating system that is made by the
            people, for the people. <br />
            These tenants are also a main factor in why many people choose
            Linux. It?s about freedom and freedom of use and freedom of choice.
